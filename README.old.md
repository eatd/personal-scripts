- **markdown_converter.py** - Bidirectional Markdown/HTML conversion with custom extensions
- **pdf_merger.py** - PDF manipulation with bookmark preservation and metadata handling
- **text_extractor.py** - Multi-format text extraction with OCR capabilities

## üéØ Technical Highlights

### Performance & Scalability
- **Concurrent processing** using ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound operations
- **Memory-efficient algorithms** for large file and dataset processing
- **Streaming parsers** for handling multi-GB log files
- **Caching mechanisms** to optimize repeated operations

### Enterprise-Ready Features
- **JSON configuration** with environment variable support
- **Structured logging** with configurable verbosity levels
- **Exit codes** for CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Progress indicators** with ETA calculations
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Code Quality
- **Type hints** throughout codebase using modern Python typing
- **Comprehensive error handling** with specific exception types
- **CLI interfaces** using argparse with subcommands and validation
- **Configuration validation** with sensible defaults
- **Modular architecture** with clean separation of concerns

## üîß Architecture & Design

### Configuration System
```python
# JSON-based configuration with environment variable override
{
  "monitoring": {
    "thresholds": {
      "cpu_percent": "${CPU_THRESHOLD:80}",
      "memory_percent": "${MEMORY_THRESHOLD:85}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# Graceful degradation with informative error messages
try:
    result = complex_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Feature unavailable: {e}")
    return fallback_implementation()
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Built-in performance metrics and timing
@timer_decorator
def process_large_dataset(data):
    with progress_bar(total=len(data)) as pbar:
        return concurrent_process(data, callback=pbar.update)
```

## üìä Usage Statistics

**Production Metrics:**
- **15+ battle-tested utilities** used in daily development workflows
- **Zero external API dependencies** for core functionality
- **Sub-second response times** for most operations
- **Memory usage < 50MB** for typical workloads
- **Cross-platform compatibility** tested on Windows 10/11, macOS, Ubuntu

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/eatd/personal-scripts.git
cd personal-scripts

# Install common dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tools with built-in help
python development-tools/project_setup.py --help
python system-utilities/process_monitor.py --continuous
python development-tools/dependency_audit.py --project ./my-project

# Configuration examples
python development-tools/port_checker.py --range 8000 8100 --timeout 0.5
python system-utilities/process_monitor.py --config monitor.json --json
```

## ‚ö° Advanced Usage

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Security audit in CI pipeline
python development-tools/dependency_audit.py --score-only > security_score.txt
if [ $(cat security_score.txt) -lt 80 ]; then exit 1; fi

# System monitoring with alerts
python system-utilities/process_monitor.py --json --config prod.json > metrics.json
```

### Automation Examples
```bash
# Project initialization workflow
python development-tools/project_setup.py my-api --config enterprise.json
cd my-api && python ../development-tools/dependency_audit.py

# System diagnostics
python system-utilities/process_monitor.py --continuous --duration 300 > system_report.log
```

## üèóÔ∏è Development Philosophy

These tools prioritize:
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms optimized for real-world datasets  
- **Usability**: Clear interfaces with helpful feedback and documentation
- **Maintainability**: Clean, typed Python following PEP 8 standards
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture and configuration-driven behavior
